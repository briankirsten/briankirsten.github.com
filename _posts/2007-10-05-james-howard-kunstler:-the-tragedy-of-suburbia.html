From the <a href="http://www.ted.com/">Ted talks series</a>, James Howard Kunstler talks about suburban sprawl and the loss of urban design. It's a longish video (21+ minutes) but still worth watching.

My favorite quote:
"If you stand at the apron of the Walmart over here and try to look at the Target over here, you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth."
