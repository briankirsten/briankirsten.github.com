title: "The Best Hamburger"
---
For most of my life I grew up in Hollywood, FL a small city in between Ft. Lauderdale and Miami. A favorite past-time of ours was to visit the beach on Hollywood, and nearly everytime we went we would pass this junky, hole-in-the-wall resturant called "Le Tub" and my parents would go, "we should go there sometime". Imagine my shock when GQ released the <a href="http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_2526">"20 Hamburgers You Must Eat Before You Die"</a> list.  There it is number #1, the Sirloin Burger at Le Tub in Hollywood. I thought "wow that's great stuff for the place, they must be loving it".

Here's except from an article from the Sun Sentinel tallking to Le Tub's owners about their #1 listing:

<i>Snorted Petrie, who has worked here for two decades: "We're getting people from Boca. ... We're getting people calling from South Beach who want directions. I say, `You don't want to come here today. Really.'"</i>
