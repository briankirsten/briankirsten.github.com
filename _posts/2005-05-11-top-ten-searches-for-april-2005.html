Nothing too shocking about April's search strings, since I've launched those comic book preview torrents I've been getting a bunch of traffic on "comic book torrent" searches. The only really kooky search string I found outside the top-ten list was "katamari damacy sofa", is someone making one of those? If so, sign me up!
