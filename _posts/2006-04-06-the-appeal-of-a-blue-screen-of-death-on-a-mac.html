From the BBC:

"<strong>Apple moves to widen Mac appeal</strong>

Boot Camp, a new utility released by Apple, makes it easy for anybody to install Windows XP on to a new Mac.

It will not work on the older G5 and G4 Macs, but it opens a whole new world of compatibility to anybody with a Mac running one of the new Intel processors.
