<p>Came across this picture in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/superamit/">Amit Gupta's Flickr stream</a>, it's a bottle of <a href="http://www.dublindrpepper.com/history.aspx">Dublin Dr. Pepper</a>. The Dr. Peppers come from the Dublin bottling plant who still use sugar (not high fructose corn syrup) in their recipe. I love this sort of thing, I'm a Dr. Pepper fan (I'll drink it over Coke or Pepsi if I'm not feeling like having iced tea or water), so finding out I can get the "classic" version of the drink will definitely get me to buy a case or two off their <a href="http://www.olddocs.com/results.aspx?cat=Drinks&amp;subcat1=Dr+Pepper">website</a>.</p>
