title: "MySpace and music videos"

One of the things that impressed me initially with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> is the music player "widget" they've got all over the site. The player's using Flash to do it's magic, so it works on my machine (a Mac), <a href="http://www.christinekirsten.com/">my wife's machine</a>, nearly everyone's machine. So I nearly fell over in shock when I clicked to watch <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gnarlsbarkley">Gnarls Barkley's</a> video for Crazy, their single off GB's first album St. Elsewhere and received this in the pop-up:

"Sorry, we currently only support Internet Explorer browsers with Windows Media Player 9+"

Ummm....MySpace just a little tip....Flash+Video=Works really well (See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>).
