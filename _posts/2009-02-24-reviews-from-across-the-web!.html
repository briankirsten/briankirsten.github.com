<a href="http://www.brainscanstudios.com/comics/index.php#watchmensch">Watchmensch</a> fever has struck the internet, reviews are starting to pop-up here and there. We've had reviews from the good folks at <a href="http://io9.com/5154032/your-first-look-at-watchmensch">i09</a>, <a href="http://newbreedofnerd.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/watchmensch/">New Breed of Nerd</a> and <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/02/21/whos-watching-the-watchmensch-comic-win-your-way-into-the-watchmen-uk-premiere/#more-20501">Slashfilm</a>. <a href="http://occasionalsuperheroine.blogspot.com/2009/02/watchmensch-story-behind-watchmen-alan.html">Occasional Superheroine</a> also had some very kind words:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.watchmensch.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Watchmensch</span></a> is important supplementary material to both the <span style="font-style: italic;">Watchmen</span> graphic novel and film that fans and media alike should read. Because the comic book provides, in a highly fanciful and irreverent way, interesting (though subjective) background information on the movie event of the Spring.</blockquote>

Lewis Lovhaug's <a href="http://www.brainscanstudios.com/comics/index.php#rotm1">Revolution of the Mask</a> is also building steam, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/blowshimselfupdude">blowshimselfupdude</a> had nothing but kind words in his audio/video review of issue #1.
