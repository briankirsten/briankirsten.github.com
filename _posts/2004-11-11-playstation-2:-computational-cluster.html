<a href="http://arrakis.ncsa.uiuc.edu/ps2/cluster.php">The NCSA has constructed a PlayStation 2 Linux cluster as a test bench for scientific computation on "toy" hardware. The cluster consists of 65 compute nodes, 4 user login and development nodes, and 1 prototype node for software installation tests. All the nodes run the Sony Linux distribution for PlayStation 2.</a>
