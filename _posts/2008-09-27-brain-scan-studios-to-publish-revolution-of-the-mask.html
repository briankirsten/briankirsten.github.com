Boston, MA Sept 27, 2008 - Brain Scan Studios proudly presents Revolution of the Mask, an exciting 12 issue maxi-series that returns superheroes to a unrecognizable Earth that discarded individuality.</p>
<p>After a Final War that decimated the planet, Earth's population now exists as 'The All.'  Individuality is irrelevant and everyone belongs to everyone else.  However, a revolution is coming - not of murder and mayhem, but of capes and costumes.  This is the Revolution of the Mask. This issue: Designation Gamma-117 knows there's something wrong with the world, but only someone Wonderful can tell him what it is.</p>
<p>Revolution of the Mask will be available in e-book format on Oct 1st. Visit the <a href="http://www.brainscanstudios.com/comics/index.php#rotm1">Brain Scan Studios website</a> for more information.</p>
