Added a link to the sidebar for my little proof of concept <a href="http://www.christineandbrian.com/monkeyking/test.xml">Comic Book Previews Podcast</a> tool. Refer to <a href="http://www.christineandbrian.com/monkeyking/archives/000501.html">this entry</a> for adding the subscription in iTunes 4.9. If anyone gets a chance to use it in other RSS readers (that support enclosures) please let me know if it works in other readers as well.

I just added a bunch of PDFS, the latest being <a href="http://www.unitprimes.com/">Unit Primes</a>.
