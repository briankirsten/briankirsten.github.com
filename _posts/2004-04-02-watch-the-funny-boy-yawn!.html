title: "Watch the funny boy yawn!"
---
I'm sure most of you have heard of the clip that was shown on <a href="http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/">Letterman</a> with the kid yawning and being generally fidgety while GW rambled on. I find this whole thing humorous on many levels, first off, it's a 13 year old kid. What 13 year old kid wouldn't be bored silly at a political type event like this? Especially with the <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/">unelectable</a> jackass like that talking? But what I find the most humorous is that this happened here in the great city of <a href="http://www.cityoforlando.net/">Orlando</a>, and the kid was one of our elected official's kids! Great work guys, nice job on getting national attention to the area.

Anyway if you haven't seen it here's the clip, enjoy.
