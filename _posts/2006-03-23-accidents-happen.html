title: "Accidents happen"

Haven't been blogging at all because of an accident my lovely <a href="http://www.christinekirsten.com">wife</a> had three weeks ago. Long story short, she was rollerblading, fell on her butt and broke a vertebre. After a 2 week hospital stay she's at home, with a brace and is slowly recovering. She didn't damage her spine and she's got full use of her arms and legs. She's in better shape now, her therapist has her walking around without the walker the hospital provided.
