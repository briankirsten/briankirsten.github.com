title: "Scary Monday"
---
I was offline all day yesterday (in bed), and for most of the night on Monday, all because of something stupid.

Went to an Indian buffet for lunch on Monday, they had this great curry I'd never tried before, wonderfully spicy so I had several helpings (not a good idea). By mid-afternoon I could feel the onset of heartburn, then all of a sudden it happened, a sharp pain in my chest and left shoulder, so bad I could hardly breath. Complained to Christine about it, she takes me to an urgent care office (like an emergency room), they take one look at me, sweating, complaining about chest pains and the horrible pain in my shoulder, and sweep me into a back room. They give me a GI (gastro-intestinal) cocktail, and then plug me into an EKG. After being satisfied that I wasn't having a heart attack, they offer me a prescription for the issue and send me on my way. Sadly the GI cocktail wears off and the pain is unbearable, the worst I'd ever felt in my life, got no sleep on Monday because of it, and stayed in on Tuesday recovering.

Now it looks like I'm stuck with watching my diet (wonderful), I glanced over a list of foods that might cause me issues: alcohol; coffee, tea, cola drinks, and other beverages containing caffeine; carbonated beverages; chocolate; citrus fruits and juices; tomatoes and tomato sauces; and spicy foods. Or in other words "any foods that have any sort of flavor" I should watch out for.

Joy. But at least I'm not in pain anymore.
