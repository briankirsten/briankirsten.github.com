On my 18th birthday, my friend John, the much older woman he was dating at the time and myself were physically thrown out of a restaurant in my former home town of Hollywood, FL. John's girlfriend at the time grew irate at the woman sitting behind her, so being the adult John's former girlfriend was, she threw an entire pitcher of beer at the woman. Needless to say, I'm yet to walk back into that restaurant.
For my 21st birthday I rented a room near Disney. Sadly I didn't plan it well, because most of the people I knew were either working or it was just too short notice for the throngs to show up.

Today I turned 30.
