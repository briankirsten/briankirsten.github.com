The tear down and rebuilding of my blog site. It's been sitting stagnant for so long, and I finally got sick of the excuses and tore it all down. I was going to initially just upgrade Wordpress, but I had nothing but trouble during the upgrade. My guess is that the original install was so old, or so filled with plug-ins and hacks that the standard upgrade just wouldn't ever work. So I exported all my years of ramblings into a fresh install, ready for me to get off my ass and work on a new look for it. I can't promise that today, tomorrow or even next week, but keep stopping on by to see what I come up with. The default Wordpress theme will continually remind me that I should be working on my site and skimming my Google reader for interesting blog entries.
