Although I'm not terribly interested in the movie itself, I must say the <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/thekingdom.html;_ylt=AiC8fRwRLedFCgEelp81OwZfVXcA">4 minute sequence that opens the movie</a> is wonderfully done. If the whole movie was done in that style maybe I'd be a bit more intrigued by it.

Just a bit of trivia, the director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000916/">Peter Berg</a> played boxer "Terry Conklin" in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116448/">"The Great White Hype"</a>.
