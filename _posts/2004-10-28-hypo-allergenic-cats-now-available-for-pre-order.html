title: "Hypo-Allergenic Cats Now Available for Pre-Order"
---
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/26/2139244">"Allerca Inc is now taking reservations for genetically engineered hypo-allergenic cats, which it calls 'lifestyle pets'... and apparently they are just the beginning... Read the press release here... and you can take delivery of a cuddy non-sinus bothering bundle of joy for just $3500...."</a>

Now I'll be able to hang around "cat people" without breaking into a sneezing and wheezing fit.
