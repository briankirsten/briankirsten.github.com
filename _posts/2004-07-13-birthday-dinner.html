title: "Birthday Dinner"
---
Been horrendously busy lately (day job + preparing for <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/">San Diego</a> next week), but here's something I thought was worthy of a blog entry.

My parents came over last week to sign all the official paperwork for the house they are building here in Orlando. Yup, after 27 years of living in South Florida they are packing up and building a castle in my neck of the woods. Going to be sad to walk out of the old house for the last time, but my parents haven't ever owned a brand new house so I think they definitely deserve it.
They decided to take me out for my birthday (it was a week before on July 3rd), and we ended up getting late reservations to the restaurant in France in Epcot Center. My meaning on late reservation is that it was for 8:50 (pm) and the park was closing at 9:00, so we would be in the restaurant for the nightly fireworks show (a great view for it too).

We were sat down and the waiter started taking our order. My mom was excited because she could get escargot (a favorite of her's and mine) so both mom and myself ordered the escargot appetizer. After a small wait our appetizers were delivered.
It was crap....it was so bad I had to eat more than one to see if it was a fluke, but indeed it was  tasteless crap. Now escargot is about the same as lobster, it's mostly about the garlic and butter, and somehow, the kitchen got garlic and butter horribly wrong. So I sent mine back telling the waiter it was horrible, and I got a look from him that gave off a "you-don't-deserve-what-you're-eating-you-worthless-ass" vibe from him.
I ended up getting a bowl off soup, not much to write about, but the only real glowing point of the night was the dessert. We decided on a dessert platter that they offered which had a bit of everything. Wonderful stuff, we cleaned the plate. Then we got the bill. The bastard left the horrible escargot's on it, instead of complaining (mostly because our waiter would completely disappear, leaving us without drinks or bread) we just left him a lousy tip.

So my recommendation to those visiting Epcot, head to France's resturant if you're in dire need of dessert and coffee. Don't get much else. (My dad's Macaroni and Cheese was pretty good....but how can someone screw that up?)
