Heading out to <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/">San Diego</a> in a couple of days (Thursday), and I finally have my booth info!

     If you're visiting the <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/">Con</a>, we (Brain Scan Studios) will be in the Small Press Section, Booth R7. I'll be signing copies of <a href="http://www.touch-of-death.com/index.php">Touch of Death</a>, showing off more art for <a href="http://rfta.brainscanstudios.com/">Rose from the Ashes</a> and I'll have free postcards for Rose as well. Come by and say hi!
