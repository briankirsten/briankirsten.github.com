First 20 minutes of <a href="http://www.kingcorn.net/">King Corn</a>, a documentary on America's addiction to the yellow crop. Here's a bit more about the movie.

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Have you been wondering why Americans are so overweight? Or why certain foods are so cheap? Have you heard our average life expectancy is headed down, not up? Two college friends set out with director Aaron Woolf in search of answers to these questions and were surprised by what they discovered. You will be too as this film follows a crop of corn from seed to your dinner plate.</blockquote>
