title: "Moved to 2.0"

For you subscriber folks, I've moved my RSS feed to 2.0, I doubt it would really affect anyone because Feedburner swallows up and spits out my feed for you folks.

Now that iTunes is supporting RSS enclosures I'm thinking I might start poking around with that, I found a Movable Type plug-in that will handle it. The trick is deciding on what content to deliver!
