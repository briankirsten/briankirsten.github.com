<a href="http://sequentiallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2006/10/need-good-laugh.html">Sequentially Speaking</a> has nothing but good things to say about our latest <a href="http://www.civil-wardrobe.com/">book</a>.

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">It's really a fun parody that pokes fun at the current comic book status-quo a little bit. And who can't laugh at it, right? If you haven't picked it up and you're in the mood for a good laugh, you should check it out.</blockquote>
