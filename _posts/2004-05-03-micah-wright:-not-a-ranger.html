title: "Micah Wright: Not a Ranger"
---
<a href="http://www.newsarama.com">Newsarama</a> has an <a href="http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12524">article</a> on <a href="http://www.micahwright.com/">Micah Ian Wright's</a> admittance to never being an Army Ranger, whole lot of back and forth arguing about this one in the message boards following the article.
I didn't even know he claimed to be a Ranger. I can see how this can rile people up because of his politically tinged writing and it doesn't help his credibility all that much, but at least he admitted it.

Also a bunch of rumbling about it at <a href="http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/pulse.cgi?http%3A//www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi%3Fubb%3Dget_topic%26f%3D36%26t%3D002175">Pulse</a>.

Can I have <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/ws_display.html?cm_ws_itemCode=swta24&amp;month=July">Stormwatch</a> back now?
