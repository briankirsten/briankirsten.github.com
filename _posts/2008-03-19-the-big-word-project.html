<p>Brian over at <a href="http://www.fairlyuseless.com/">Fairly Useless</a> directed me over to <a href="http://www.thebigwordproject.com/">The Big Word Project</a>. The concept is simple, you purchase a word to redefine it. The redefinition is in the form of a link, so naturally</p>
<p>we bought "publisher" and linked it to <a href="http://www.brainscanstudios.com/">us</a>.</p>
