Today I noticed that my <a href="http://www.torrentflux.com">TorrentFlux</a> installation (the thing that's seeding my comic book preview torrents) started showing odd ownership changes for my older torrents, turns out it was just a setting in the config file. All's good now, everyone can calm down and get some much needed rest.
