Make another concious push towards newstand sales and give them to doctors and barbers. My corner store sold me Justice League when I was 6 years old, that's why I like comics. But every comic on the newstand needs to be great. If the Justice League hadn't been starting the Giffen-Dematties era then I doubt I'd still be reading comics. Giffen-Dematties JLA's where the comics that had me hooked until I was old enough to go to specialty stores.</a>
