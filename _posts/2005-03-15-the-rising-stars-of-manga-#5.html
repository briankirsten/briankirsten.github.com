title: "The Rising Stars of Manga #5"
---
Ok, I'll be brutally honest, I'm not a big fan of manga. I've tried, picked up various titles at the stores and shows...and always put them down. I really don't know why, but I can't get into them. Maybe someday I will. Anywhoo, based on that information you might find it odd that I'm writing about Tokyopop's latest <a href="http://www.tokyopop.com/news/mangatalent/decide/">The Rising Stars of Manga</a> competition. The main reason's is Erich Owen, artist extraordinaire (worked with him on <a href="http://epiphany.keenspace.com/">Epiphany</a>) and Joshua Elder has a short comic story in the running titled <a href="http://www.tokyopop.com/news/mangatalent/decide/index.php?propertycode=mai&amp;categorycode=BMG&amp;isbn=1111111111&amp;lefttoright=1&amp;pages=22">Mail Order Ninja</a>. I enjoyed the heck out of it and hope you do too. And if you'd like, vote for them <a href="http://www.tokyopop.com/news/surveys/survey.php?surveyid=1038">here</a>.
