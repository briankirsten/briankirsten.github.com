title: "Touch of Death on the web"
---
I've decided to experiment a bit and serialize <a href="http://www.touch-of-death.com/">Touch of Death</a> entirely in web comic form (which seems to be all the rage these days). I'm going to be publishing two pages a day for the next couple of months, you can start reading <a href="http://webcomics.brainscancomics.com/2007/02/23/touch-of-death-cover/">here</a> or subscribe via rss <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BrainScanWebcomics">here</a>.
