title: "Fairly Useless, a new blog for tech geeks"
---
I've got a buddy who's started his first blog, <a href="http://www.fairlyuseless.com/">Fairly Useless</a>. It's mostly tech related, and there are only a few articles, but what he's got so far are great reads.

His latest is an <a href="http://www.fairlyuseless.com/2006/08/09/new-pocketmod-modules/">article on Pocket Mods</a>.
