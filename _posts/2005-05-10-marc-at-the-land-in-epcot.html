I don't know why, but I love this picture, I was shocked at how good it came out. It happened by accident, I had only 1 picture left, I was in a place that I could easily change my film so I just snapped a picture of my baby brother. I wish I could tell you what speed and aperture, my guess is that I just set it to the middle-most settings and pressed the button.<p />

Taken in the new and improved "The Land" pavilion in Epcot.
