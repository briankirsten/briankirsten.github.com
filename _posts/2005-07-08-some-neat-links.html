<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/06/07/1and1_changes_its_tu.html">1&amp;1 changes its tune about BitTorrent </a> - Hosting company 1&amp;1 initally didn't want folks running BitTorrent servers off their hosted accounts, 1&amp;1 claimed they didn't want folks eating up bandwidth.

<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/06/10/photographer_grills_.html">Photographer grills security guard about dumb policy</a> - I just slap myself on the forehead when I read this line from the article (the quote is refering to a person taking pictures) "Well, they don't mind eye-level stuff, but when you point the camera up, they start to get nervous. Since 9/11, you know, terrorism".
