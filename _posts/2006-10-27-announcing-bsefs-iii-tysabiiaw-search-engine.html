title: "Announcing BSEfS Iii Tysabiiaw search engine"
---
So I was over at <a href="http://www.xnlb.com/blog/58/new-music-search-engine/">Xenlab's blog</a> checking out the <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=001449325277413797551%3Aljyin3deahu">search engine</a> he created with the new Google Co-Op service, when I realized that this opened a new opportunity for me. To allow (force) people to search through all the great websites (muck) that I'm interested in! So I proudly announce <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=017929486777490336759%3A58gnfsn-5ti">BSEfS Iii Tysabiiaw</a> (Brian's Search Engine for Stuff I'm interested in that you should also be interested in as well)!

Enjoy and search your heads off.
