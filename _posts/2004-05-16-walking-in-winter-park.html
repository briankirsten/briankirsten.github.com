Just before it started to rain. This time, I downloaded straight from the memory stick, to iPhoto, and in <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto</a> I did all the importing and converting straight from iPhoto. I never got anything like this in the world of Windows.

Great gravy I love <a href="http://www.apple.com/">macs</a>.
