title: "What an interesting blogosphere we live in."

Added some features to the <a href="http://www.blogbuzzmachine.com">Blog Buzz Machine</a>, nothing too useful for regular folks yet, just stuff like: A) List of total blogs tracked (over 22,000!) B) The thing that I've been working on for over a day now, an RSS auto-discovery script. See when BBM get's pings or reads from other ping services most times it's just the Blog Name and URL that's being sent over. Well obviously I'm interested in the RSS side of things so I've been poking through a script from <a href="http://keithdevens.com/weblog/archive/2002/Jun/03/RSSAuto-DiscoveryPHP">Keith Devens website</a> for hitting a URL and finding the RSS/Atom feed on the site. And I've get a script to do just that and even better it prunes the database for sites that don't seem to have any feeds (you can hit the BBM website and notice the database pruning every once in a while).

Anyway my new habit is randomly visiting the updated blogs on the front page of BBM, it's fun to do and I've been exposed to all different types of people. Try it sometime.

Why aren't you pinging us yet? Just head over to <a href="http://www.blogbuzzmachine.com">BBM</a> or add us as a service in your blogging tool, just send a ping to <a href="http://rpc.blogbuzzmachine.com/RPC2">http://rpc.blogbuzzmachine.com/RPC2</a>.
