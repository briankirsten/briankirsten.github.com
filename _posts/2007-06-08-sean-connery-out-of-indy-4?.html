<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Sean Connery announced Thursday he would not take part in the fourth instalment of the "Indiana Jones" adventure films, saying he would rather enjoy his retirement.

In a statement on the film's official website, Connery, 76, said he had thought "long and hard" about reprising his role as Professor Henry Jones from 1989's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."

"I love working with Steven and George, and it goes without saying that it is an honor to have Harrison as my son. But in the end, retirement is just too damned much fun."</blockquote>
