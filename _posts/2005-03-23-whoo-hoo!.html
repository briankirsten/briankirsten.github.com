It's working!

Was playing with <a href="">TorrentFlux</a> last night, couldn't get it working initially. It would attempt to load the torrent and just kind of sit there, but this forum <a href="http://www.torrentflux.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=355">entry (Torrent Start Freez, Version 1.5 / Freez / Javascript Error)</a> got it all working!

For those of you who care, TorrentFlux is a php based system that enables the server to seed torrents. So all my torrents (as long as the server is running) will be permanently seeded. Which is friggen sweet!
