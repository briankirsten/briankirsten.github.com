title: "New Features and Beta Test"
---
I've added <a href="http://www.blogbuzzmachine.com/most_popular.php">"Most Popular Blogs"</a> to <a href="http://www.blogbuzzmachine.com/">Blog Buzz Machine</a>, it features (duh) the most popular blogs in the Blog Buzz Machine universe.

I currently have folks beta testing some of the other neat features of Blog Buzz Machine. Want to be added to the beta test? Email me at <a href="mailto:brian.kirsten.bss@gmail.com">brian.kirsten.bss@gmail.com</a> to join the Beta test team.
