title: "New Store!"
---
Been working on building a store for all the stuff we want to sell through Brain Scan Studios, started playing with OSCommerce but I ended up using <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/modules/frontpage/">Zen Cart</a> because it worked well with my merchant account service and it was a bit easier to manipulate the design of the cart. Now the new store is prettier, fancier, the credit card processing isn't as clunky as before, and I bought an SSL certificate (The prior store would bounce over to my merchant account's website using their SSL certificate), this is much more sexy looking.

<a href="http://www.brainscanstudios.net/store">Check out the new store</a>

Check back often, I'll be moving Christine's photographic prints there as well some Touch of Death T-Shirts I have left over and I've got some new t-shirt designs I'm kicking around as well. Oh and possibly a print of Andrew Robinson's amazing cover for <a href="http://www.rosecomic.com">Rose #1</a>.
