title: "UCF Ham Radio operator served as main link in tsunami disaster"
---
This was reported a while ago, but I still think it's damn neat....(My wife Christine, her sister Susan and I are all UCF alums)

"A <a href="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~k4ucf/">University of Central Florida</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_radio">ham radio</a> operator <a href="http://www.qrz.com/detail/K4VUD">K4VUD</a>  (and <a href="http://film.ucf.edu/index.php?URL=faculty&amp;&amp;facultyURL=harpole">founder of their film program</a>) was caught in <a href="http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/andamanandnicobar/portblair.htm">Port Blair</a> during the earthquake and following tsunami! He and a team of other ham radio operators arrived in the <a href="http://www.and.nic.in/">Andaman
  and Nicobar Islands</a> to setup the <a href="http://unchainedheart.org/k4vud.htm">region's first ham station</a> 2 weeks prior to the disaster. Once they realized what happened they immediately <a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2004/12/27/2/?nc=1">began transmitting for 20 straight hours</a> using car batteries as a power source. Most cellular and land-line communication was down.  His team became the main link to the rest of the world from the <a href="http://odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/in.html">region</a>."
