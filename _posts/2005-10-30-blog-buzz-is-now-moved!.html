title: "Blog Buzz is now moved!"
---
Long story short...I've had a Sun Ultra 60 box (much thanks Steve!) sitting in the office for a while waiting for me to get some time to start beating it over the head. Earlier this week I moved all the databases for all my database-driven websites over to it allowing my poor little webserver to breath a little easier. My last task was to move <a href="http://www.blogbuzzmachine.com/index.php">BlogBuzz's</a> ever-growing database (over 37,000 blogs!) over to the Sun machine.

And it's finally done, Kalloo Kallay!

Hopefully the whole operation's going to run a bit better now.
