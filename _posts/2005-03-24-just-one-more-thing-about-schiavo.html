title: "Just one more thing about Schiavo"
---
(Crap I just had to get myself going about this...)

From this <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;e=1&amp;u=/ap/20050324/ap_on_re_us/brain_damaged_woman&amp;sid=84439559">AP article</a>:
Jeb Bush and the state's social services agency filed a petition in state court to take custody of Schiavo and, presumably, reconnect her feeding tube. It cites new allegations of neglect and challenges Schiavo's diagnosis as being in a persistent vegetative state. The request is based on the opinion of a neurologist working for the state who observed Schiavo at her bedside but <b>did not conduct an examination of her</b>.

The neurologist, William Cheshire of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, is a bioethicist who is also an active member in Christian organizations, <b>including two whose leaders have spoken out against the tube's removal</b>.

Emphasis added by me.

I just want to bang my head against the wall...but I might fall subject to all this crap should something happen to me.
