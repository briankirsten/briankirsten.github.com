Thanks to the magic of Youtube (w00t Youtube!), I got to see the only part of the Grammy's I was interested in. The show was highlighted by a brief performance of the Beatles "A Day in the Life" from the Cirque du Soleil show "Love" shown in the Mirage hotel in Las Vegas. The Grammy's version of the Cirque show didn't really capture how absolutely wonderful the Las Vegas version is.
My wife and I got to see "Love" on it's first "test" night, completely by luck (well actually it was due to the ineptitude of Frontier airlines). Two weeks prior to our vacation Frontier notified us that our Friday flight had been bumped to the next morning. We went into frantic mode because we generally don't stay in Vegas over the weekend due to the extreme bounces in hotel prices (or in our case our hotel was sold out for that night). After finding a suitable replacement, I discovered that the first ever public showing of "Love" was going to be going on that Friday, and surprisingly I was able to grab two tickets. So in the end it worked out for the best. To folks heading to Vegas, I can't say enough about how wonderful this show is, definitely one of the best stage shows I'd ever seen.
