For the folks who care, I've been accepted as a fellow blogger over at <a href="http://orlando.metblogs.com/">Metroblogging Orlando</a> (Which is really nice, because I live in the Orlando area). I'll be blogging over there about Orlando events, stuff we've done over the weekend and anything else that comes to mind (regarding Orlando).
