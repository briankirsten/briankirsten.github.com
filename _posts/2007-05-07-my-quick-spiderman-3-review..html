Did <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/">Sam Raimi</a> forget to take his pills?

Venom = Cool
Sandman = Cool
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001497/">Tobey Maguire's</a> quivering bottom lip = Crap multiplied by every single audience member cringing from watching a grown man melt into dramatic goo.
Tobey pretending he's a pimp/dance-a-thon = Crap
Bruce Cambell = Badass
