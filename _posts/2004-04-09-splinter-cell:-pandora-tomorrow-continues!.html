title: "Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow Continues!"

Yes, surprisingly I continue to play this instead of <a href="http://halo.bungie.net/">Halo</a> (I must have some other games for this system, but for some reason before I got Splinter Cell I was always playing Halo. Well not for some reason, I was playing Halo because in my honest opinion it has to be one of the best video games to come out in years).

Anyway, I'm still trudging along in Splinter Cell, and either I am getting old, or it is one tough little game. But I will figure it out (thank goodness for walkthroughs), now I just need to check out the online version which I heard is badass.
