Testing the PDF reader/enclosure thing with iTunes 4.9 (although I would imagine this would work with any other RSS reader that supports enclosures).

Add <a href="http://www.christineandbrian.com/monkeyking/test.xml">this</a> to your podcast subscription list in iTunes 4.9 (click on Podcasts, then click on the "Advanced" menu then "Subscribe to Podcast" and paste the <a href="http://www.christineandbrian.com/monkeyking/test.xml">url</a> in the box thing). It should end up going out and grabbing the ToD #1 PDF as an enclosure to the file then you can read it through iTunes.
