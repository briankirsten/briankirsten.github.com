title: "Chef Grant Achatz cancer free"
---
Earlier this year Chef Grant Achatz of the fabulous Chicago restaurant <a href="http://www.alinea-restaurant.com/">Alinea</a> was diagnosed with tongue cancer, shocking foodies and his contemporaries across the world. Happily, Chef Achatz and his family has received an early Christmas gift in the form of his cancer going into remission, the news coming from a statement from the talented chef.

I wish him, his family and all you fine folks happiness and health.
