Currently it's 11:00PM and time for us kids to be in bed. This is blog entry number one! I RUULE! Hopefully I will get off my fat ass and continue writing blog entries in this new and exciting blog.

Of course I don't need to get off my ass to write in the blog, but you get the point.

Oh and I finally bought an XBOX game <a href="http://www.splintercell.com/uk/home.php?change_version=flash">Splinter Cell, Pandora's Tommorow</a>.
It's pretty sweet. Hard. But sweet.

And to all a good night!
