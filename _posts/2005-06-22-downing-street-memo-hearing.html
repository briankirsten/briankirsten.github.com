title: "Downing Street Memo hearing"
---
From the article:
"We were forced to convene the hearing in a small room in the basement of the Capitol as the Republicans would not make any other room available to us. Then, the Republican Leadership scheduled 11 consecutive floor votes at the precise time the hearing was scheduled to begin. My research shows that this is more votes that have been scheduled at any other time in the last ten years since the GOP takeover of the House."
