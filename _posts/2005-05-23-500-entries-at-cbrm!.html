title: "500 entries at CBRM!"
---
We'll we've hit that magic 500 entry mark over at <a href="http://cbrm.brainscanstudios.net/">Comic Book Review Machine</a>. Traffic is starting to build on the site which is always nice to see. If you haven't figured it out (or visited the site) CBRM is my attempt to build a comprehensive searchable database of comic book reviews from all over the web. Next on my list of functionality additions for the site are user registrations, tagging and possibly search personalization. Let me know if your using the site and how you like it so far!
