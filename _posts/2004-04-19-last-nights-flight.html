title: "Last Nights Flight"
---
Due to <a href="http://www.frontierairlines.com">Frontier</a> canceling our original flight, we had to fly out of Orlando pretty late in the afternoon for our honeymoon. The first flight to our Denver layover was a joy, good legroom, decent snack, and Direct TV satellite for each of us. The flight to San Francisco though...wow did that suck wind. It was hot, cramped, the plane was ridiculously old (I'm not the greatest of flyers, and the last thing I want to see is a plane that's older than my youngest brother), I was counting the seconds for us to land.
