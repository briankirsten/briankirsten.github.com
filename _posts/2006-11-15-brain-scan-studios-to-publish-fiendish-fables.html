---
Brain Scan Studios proudly presents Fiendish Fables, a new horror filled
anthology from the mind of John Schlim Jr. and friends.  A collection of
creepy short stories inspired by the classic horror comics that defined
the genre! Marauding zombie kids, a bloodthirsty vampire horse,
vengeance-seeking storybook creatures, a wild west monster, the debut of
"Goth Ghost Girl," a ghastly gallery, and much more. Cover created by
David Wachter.

Fiendish Fables has 48 pages of amazing art and writing for $3.50! It
will be available for order in the January "Previews" and will be released in
March 2007.
