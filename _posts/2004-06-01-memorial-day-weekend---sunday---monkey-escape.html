While in Animal Kingdom, we watched this monkey jump from his island "habitat" over to a nearby rock and climbed up a tree where he obviously wasn't supposed to be. We thought it was pretty neato, but he was so close to the walkway that hopefully nobody grabbed him and ran off with him.

I don't think the monkey ate any people.

Yet.
