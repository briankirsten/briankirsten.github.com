For those of you who don't know me, I love beer, so we' ve been planning on attending this big beer/food festival thing in the heart of Miami (Bayfront Park). We ended up heading over to <a href="http://www.fabfest.com">FAB Festival</a> last Saturday. Here's are some <a href="http://www.christineandbrian.com/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=miami2005">pictures</a> that <a href="http://www.christinekirsten.com">Christine</a> took.
