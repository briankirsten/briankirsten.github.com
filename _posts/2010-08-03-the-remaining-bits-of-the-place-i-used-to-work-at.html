title: "The remaining bits of the place I used to work at"
---
<p>When <a href="http://www.travelatro.com">Travelatro</a> (the place I used to work at) went out of business I was constantly reminded by Amazon of the back-up files they had left on S3. Since there was nothing left of the company, I downloaded the backups so I wouldn't continually be hounded by Amazon for the space Travelatro was taking up and the fact that my former boss couldn't be bothered to pay for the service Amazon was providing. After sitting on my Macbook Pro for eons, I finally got around to archiving the bits of my former job off my machine onto dvd. 8 years of me and my former co-workers lives fit onto 4 dvds. <p /> Kind of sad.</p>
