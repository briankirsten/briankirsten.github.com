<p>Yes kids, I've started <a href="http://twitter.com/bkirsten">Twittering</a> so people who are interested in that sort thing can following me <a href="http://twitter.com/bkirsten">here</a>. Follow with reckless abandon such exciting activities as:</p>
<p>Updating my PS3!</p>
<p>Complaining about lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Bitching about lousy service.</p>
<p>Fun and excitement for all! For those who REALLY REALLY care about this sort of thing, I'm using <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">twhirl</a> for my desktop tweets, I have no complaints so far.</p>
