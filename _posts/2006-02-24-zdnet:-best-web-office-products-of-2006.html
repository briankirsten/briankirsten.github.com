<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=123">Web Office Suite: best of breed products</a> - I personally use <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a> and <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> from this list. All great products, I just recently completely moved all my email to Gmail, it's one of the best software migrations I've done in a while!
