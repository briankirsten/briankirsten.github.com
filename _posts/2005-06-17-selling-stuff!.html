title: "Selling stuff!"

I've added a <a href="http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQfgtpZ1QQfrppZ25QQsassZbrainscanstudios">My eBay Auctions</a> link to the sidebar, our townhouse will be done in a little over a month (cross our fingers) so I'll be dropping things onto eBay while we're cleaning and packing the apartment.
My first auction is a stack of <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=77&amp;item=6539589347&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW">Touch of Death #1's</a>, buy one and I'll autograph it/sketch a funny little man onto it if you like (just let me know if you want any of that).
Over the next coming weeks will be adding stuff when it comes along.

Thanks for listening to my ranting...now run along, it's a nice day out.
