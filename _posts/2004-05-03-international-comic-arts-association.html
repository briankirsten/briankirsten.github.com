Got an email a couple days ago that the International Comic Arts Association website is now live. I've ranted about this <a href="http://www.christineandbrian.com/monkeyking/archives/000028.html">before</a>, it's exactly (one of the things) that the comic industry needs.

Go <a href="http://www.comicarts.org/index.php">check them out</a> and send them some cash or comics if you can.
