<a href="http://newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=8215284b409d045610b3c6ecf551d6fd&amp;threadid=13718">Newsarama</a> has an interview with <a href="http://www.brianwood.com/">Brian Wood</a> about Demo reaching it's halfway point, his thoughts on the previous six issues as well as information and art on the next 6.

I have repeated this time and time again, check this series out! <a href="http://www.ait-planetlar.com/demo.shtml">Demo</a> is great stuff!
