title: "One Last Song review at Atomic Avenue"

<a href="http://www.atomicavenue.com/atomic/titledetail.aspx?TitleID=26888">Atomic Avenue has some nice things to say about One Last Song #1</a>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The future One Last Song paints is bleak, though perhaps not completely unrealistic given the current political climate of the United States, and the interesting artistic choices by creators CJ Hurtt and Shawn Richter, especially in the way of panel layout and scene juxtaposition (they like to cross-cut a lot), really sell the paranoia and general unease that make this book compelling.</blockquote>
