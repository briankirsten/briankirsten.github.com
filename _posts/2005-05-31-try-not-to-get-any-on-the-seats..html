title: "Try not to get any on the seats."

Had a full weekend: helped mom and dad move stuff their new place (here in currently soggy Orlando), knocked some golf balls over at the driving range, went to Typhoon Lagoon, and finally saw Star Wars III.

The best thing about the movie? The Batman Begins trailer in the beginning. The War of the Worlds trailer was damn neat as well. The movie itself? Well Star Wars III isn't horrible by any sense of the word, it's just not all that good. Is this movie better than II &amp; I? Of course! Sadly II &amp; I are heaping piles of crap so this movie had to try really hard to get worse.

What was it all about? It was pretty much all about jerking-off the fanboys. I won't lie, I'm a Star Wars nut, so there were plenty of "hey look at that" nudge nudge wink wink moments for me. But it just felt hollow, you could sit and watch the entire movie, walk out and yell "Well I'm glad all of that is cleared up, but did I really need to know this information?".

I knew the movie officially went bad for me when I was happy that Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) burst into flame, I actually cracked a smile when that happened. Not because officially we finally get to see how this character's mangled mess of a body becomes the Darth Vadar we all know, but because literally I was happy that he was on fire. Yes, it's as sick as that sounds. And no I'm not going to seek counseling for that, because if you haven't seen this movie you have yet to experience the overwhelming need to watch and enjoy that man catching on fire.

So, should you see the movie? Again I won't lie to you, some of the action sequences are excellent (although the supposedly famous fight scene between Anakin and Obi-Wan really wasn't all that neat) and the movie is made to show you all those scenes that some of us has been dying to see all these years. So it can fall into 2 camps: 1) If you've put yourself through the first two movies, you might as well finish it off, trust me it's better than I &amp; II. 2) If you're a fanboy at heart and really need to see everything you've been dreaming about all these years, then get it over with and go see the movie.
