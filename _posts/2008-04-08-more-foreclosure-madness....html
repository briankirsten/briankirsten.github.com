<p>These folks should never been allowed to buy houses...</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Some South Floridians who lose their houses to foreclosure try to get even. They'll strip the plumbing, ruin the carpets and rip out doors.</p>
  <p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Exasperated lenders are getting wise to the ruse and offering "cash for keys" deals, essentially paying homeowners as much as $2,000 not to take out their frustrations on their properties before leaving. Roughly half of all foreclosed properties are returned to the bank with substantial damage, according to a national survey of 1,500 real estate agents by Campbell Communications, a marketing and research firm in Washington, D.C.</p>
