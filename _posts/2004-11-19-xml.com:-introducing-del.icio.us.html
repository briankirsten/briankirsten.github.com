title: "XML.com: Introducing del.icio.us"
---
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/11/10/delicious.html">You're putting some effort into contributing information to  del.icio.us, and it repays you by exposing its data and  functionality in several ways so that you can get it back again  without asking any favors or getting special access. It has an HTTP API for posting and  managing your account. Nearly every useful page has a related RSS  feed, exposing not just the human-readable titles and links but  also neatly structured machine-readable information on tags and  authorship. Finally, for the odd bit of stuff not exposed through  an API or RSS feed, the HTML is free of presentational fluff and  cleanly marked up with useful CSS classes.</a>
