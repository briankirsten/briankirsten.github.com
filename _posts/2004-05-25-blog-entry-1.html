The title to this entry is obviously a bit misleading, this is not my first blog entry. This is my first blog entry copied from my new <a href="http://www.modoemodo.com/">Moleskine</a> notebook. I bought a couple of these based on a <a href="http://boingboing.net/2004/05/19/marks_japan_journal.html">blog entry</a> from <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>. The entry mentioned how great the notebooks were so I had to get one to try out.  I can understand why the Moleskine is so wonderful. It has a wonderful, classic feel to it, and writing on it with my "new-fangled" <a href="http://www.pilotpen.us/detail.asp?PenID=7">Pilot gel pen</a> just feels good.

For those of you who don't know me, I would call myself a "computer geek". So why would a self proclaimed "geek" want to use (gasp!) paper and pen? I really don't have an answer for it. I guess it's because I love a good mix of "modernness" with my "classic-ness".  I know I could just use the numerous gadgets I've amassed over the years to work on my new <a href="http://rfta.brainscanstudios.com/">project</a>, write blog entries and to jot down research material, but this feels....better somehow.
I can now blog from, thanks to <a href="http://new.bastish.net/cgi-bin/mfop2/index.cgi">mFop2</a>, my <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/phones/6800">cell phone</a> for example. But something like my phone isn't as easy as pulling out the new notebook and jotting a long string of sentences down like I'm doing right now.
Also, going back to my enjoyment of the "classic-ness" of this particular brand of notebook, I guess it's just one of my odd tastes. I love shopping at little local grocery stores and meat markets, probably due to the encroachment of the supersized "Walmarts" of the world, spreading like a pox across the countryside. I don't really know how liking small stores versus "Walmart-like" stores connects with me using a notebook (paper one) versus my cell phone/PDA/notebook (electronic one), especially since I really do love using all those things. Maybe I just want a simple non-electronic thing in my mess of electronic things.

One of the negatives to the notebook is that I seem to ramble a bit. Pardon my rambling.
