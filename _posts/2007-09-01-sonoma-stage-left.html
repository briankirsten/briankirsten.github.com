I filmed this with my Sony Ericsson K610i so the quality is so-so. Originally I had filmed it landscape mode, I thought I could convert it in iMovie but the only options I could find were plug-ins for iMovie you had to pay for (booo). I came across this <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070122085020753">post over at macosxhints </a>to use <a href="http://www.tanjero.com/bitplayer/">BitPlayer</a> (free! w00t!) to rotate the movie.
