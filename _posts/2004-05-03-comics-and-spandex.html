<a href="http://gutterninja.blogspot.com">Gutterninja</a> has a great blog entry about comics and the stigma they have over them regarding super heroes. It's the old "comics are just about people in capes right?" argument, stuff I definitely feel strongly about (especially since I currently don't write any super hero stuff). Good stuff.

Check out the entry <a href="http://gutterninja.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_gutterninja_archive.html#108333124794341635">here</a>.
