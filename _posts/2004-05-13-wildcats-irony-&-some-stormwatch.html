Head over to the <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/wildstorm/index.html">Wildstorm</a> site, look down at the area that says "Message Boards", hopefully you will see a picture of one of the Coda and underneath it, the following:

CODA WAR ONE
 How can the <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/ws_display.html?cm_ws_itemCode=wcv321&amp;month=May">WILDCATS</a> hope to survive?

Easy, DON'T CANCEL IT YOU BASTARDS! (I added the link to the latest Wildcats issue)

You may all now go about your business.

Oh and Stormwatch #22 is out today. Pick it up, it's enjoyable.
