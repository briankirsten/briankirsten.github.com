<blockquote>&gt; THE X-AXIS
&gt; 4 February 2007
&gt; ===============

&gt; ULTIMATE CIVIL WAR SPIDER-HAM FEATURING WOLVERHAM #1 - I don't generally
&gt; review books that I read in the store, but then you don't generally see
&gt; books so devoid of content that I can finish them in the store.

You went further than I did, I picked it up, considered buying it and read a
few pages before putting it right back down.

&gt; There's a token and moderately promising set-up sequence, and then... it's
&gt; a poster book.  A poster book of various Marvel characters as pigs.  With
&gt; endless puns on the word ham.  Repeat until funny.  Except it never is.

Even worse, it's a blatant rip-off of Rick Johnson's actually funny "Civil
Wardrobe" (<a href="http://www.civil-wardrobe.com/)">http://www.civil-wardrobe.com/)</a> - Scientologist Thor - now that's
funny!

&gt; It's another in the recent string of jaw-dropping artefacts that make you
&gt; wonder just how badly off-centre Marvel's quality control has become, and
&gt; whether anyone in editorial is actually devoting critical thought to the
&gt; efforts of favoured creators.  I mean, this is horrible - it's not even
&gt; "not funny" in the way that Christmas cracker jokes aren't funny.  It's
&gt; not funny in the way that chairs and rocks aren't funny. Absolutely
&gt; ungodly dreadful, and in all seriousness, something is terribly wrong when
&gt; comics this bad are making the shelves.  D

And very pathetic that it comes out after a far better parody by an
independent publisher. Presumably, they saw Civil Wardrobe being something
of a success for the indies, but realised that they could get bigger sales
with a rip-off featuring a very tired old parody character of their own.
