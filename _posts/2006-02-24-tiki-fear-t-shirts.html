title: "Tiki Fear T-Shirts"
---
Every once in a while I come up with sick little quotes that I'd love to see on a t-shirt. So instead of jotting them down and going, "hey someday I'll have to throw that on a shirt" I opened a little CafePress shop to collect my ideas.

I'm calling it, <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/tikifear">Tiki Fear Shirts</a>, and it's not for the faint of heart. Here's my first <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/tikifear.48824276">shirt</a> for the line.

Enjoy.
