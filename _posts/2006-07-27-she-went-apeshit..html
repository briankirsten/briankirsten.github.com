title: "She went apeshit."
---
I just watched the end of a <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html">Trading Spaces</a>, where after the reveal, the women completely freaked out and had to leave the room. She hated the room so much she pretty much said (I'm misquoting but here's the gist of it), "We're going to have to take a lot of time ripping everything down."

Holy crap.

The look on Paige's face was priceless (It was an old episode).
