title: "Idea Blogging"
---
Why do I have ideas for stuff to write at places where I can't easily write said idea down? I do a whole lot of mental writing while waiting in line at the grocery store, showering, working at my full-time job, etc. But when I get to place where I can write those brillant ideas....nothing...nada, I draw a complete blank.

So just give me something that will plug directly into my brain. Nothing huge, I don't want it to record every aspect of my life. Just little notes here and there, "idea blogging", "brain blogging"...whatever.
