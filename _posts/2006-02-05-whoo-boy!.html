<a href="http://www.blogbuzzmachine.com">Blog Buzz Machine's</a> RPC server got hit 5.5 million times last month. It's just insane to me (especially since the site is running on some very limited hardware). I've got the <a href="http://rpc.blogbuzzmachine.com/RPC2">RPC site</a> down for the time being, the blog pings have been overwhelming the web server (I've been restarting every couple of hours). New hardware is coming this week, hopefully it'll alleviate some of the growing pains we've been having.

In the meantime, why don't you send me an email at <a href="mailto:brian.kirsten.bss@gmail.com">brian.kirsten.bss@gmail.com</a> asking to be part of BBM's beta test?
