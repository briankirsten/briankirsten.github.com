	<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes I know, <a href="http://www.onelastsong.com">One Last Song #1</a> is not even out yet. But the fine folks over at <a href="http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/">The Forbidden Planet</a> got a sneak peak at OLS and had a whole lot of kind things to say about it.

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">After a few fallow years following 9-11 and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan there was, especially in the US, a real reluctance to be seen criticising government policy for fear of being seen to be unpatriotic; One Last Song pushes this sort of behaviour and the attendant harsh new laws and restrictions on freedoms which came with them to an extreme, joining recent comics such as Brian Wood’s excellent DMZ or Anthony Lappe and Dan Goldman’s Shooting War in a growing field of comics which aren’t afraid to comment about current events. This first issue certainly got me hooked and I want to see where this is going to go; given the set-up I don’t think readers can assume there will be a happy ending and that is part of the appeal, not knowing.</blockquote>
