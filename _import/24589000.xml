	<content:encoded><![CDATA[With a constant desire to be healthy I've become more interested in different ways of not necessarily losing weight but becoming healthier all around. My "dieting" history has been varied, I've tried the "only eat lunch diet", the "only eat dinner diet", Atkins (consuming astounding amounts of bacon), and Body for Life (which actually worked very well for me).
Now folks are talking about the "GI" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_Index">Glycemic Index</a>) of foods which is defined (from Wikipedia) as:

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">...the area under the 2 hour blood glucose response curve (AUC) following the ingestion of a fixed portion of carbohydrate (usually 50 g). The AUC of the test food is divided by the AUC of the standard (either glucose or white bread) and multiplied by 100. The average GI value is calculated from data collected in 10 human subjects. Both the standard and test food must contain an equal amount of available carbohydrate. The result gives a relative ranking for each tested food (Brouns et al, 2005).</blockquote>

So the guts of all this is sugar, and so during my research I wanted to find out how to cut some of that sugar intake down. That's when I came across how bad <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup">high fructose corn syrup</a> (HFCS) is. Everybody's heard of it, but do you realize how much stuff has HCFS in it? During lunch alone I counted 5 seperate instances of it (and all I ordered was a three item combo meal). Now this stuff is mostly in processed food (which I've sworn to cut out but is tough due to my work's location which has an overwhelming lack of decent places to eat), so if you stick with a bit more natural diet you'll be able to stay away from HFCS.

Today <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/23/is_highfructose_corn.html">Boing Boing had entry about it</a>, here's an excerpt:

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Since reading Greg Critser's Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World, I've regarded high-fructose corn syrup as a kind of toxic waste, present in an unbelievable amount of processed/packaged food. But as with all issues related to commerce and obesity, HFCS is a controversial subject, with woo-woo UFOlogist pseudoscientists on both sides inventing virtues or flaws with HFCS.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>
