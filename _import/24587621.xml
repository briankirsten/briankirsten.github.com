Anyone want a hard drive enclosure? I just got a new one in the hopes of upgrading to firewire (although I'm yet to be able to use the firewire with the new enclosure...just the usb....I will figure out what's wrong!).

My old enclosure was really flakey with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X 10.3</a>, just a warning to those who are interested. But it does work fine, and I owned it for only about a year.

Kind of a humorous story on why I purchased the original enclosure. I had a pretty sweet Toshiba laptop which I brought to work everyday. Most days I would have breakfast at my desk, then one day I dropped an entire bowl of Raisin Bran on my laptop. I quickly realized two things. One: Cereal and expensive computers don't mix. Two: Maybe it's time to move to that Powerbook I've been checking out. The only thing that was recoverable from the old machine was the hard drive. But it all turned out good in the end because my next laptop purchase was my wonderful <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Powerbook</a>. Ah so nice, never to return to <a href="http://www.windows-sucks.com/">Windows</a> again!

Anyway here's the <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=4131971903">eBay auction for the enclosure</a>.]]></content:encoded>
