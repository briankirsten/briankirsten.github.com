Twentieth Century Fox and Marvel Entertainment have bolstered the mutant roster for "X-Men 3" with Kelsey Grammer, who is set to play Beast, the oversized blue-furred creature who has not yet appeared in an "X-Men" film.

While Grammer might seem a surprise to play a 355-pound blue-colored brute, producer Avi Arad said, "Kelsey was born to play the role," explaining that Beast is the most intelligent of the mutants, a pacifist Ph.D. and genetic researcher named Hank McCoy.

Fox has begun negotiations with "Lost's" Maggie Grace to play the role of Kitty Pryde, a beauty who can walk through walls. Studio is also searching for an actor to play Angel, a handsome winged mutant who is ashamed of his feathery appendages.
