	<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend we also came down to say good-bye to my parents house. By this time next week they'll have moved out, saying good-bye to 27 years of ownership. When they happily told us over a month ago that they found a buyer it just didn't really sink in. The house that had been ours for so long will soon be just one of many tour stops when we visit South Florida.

But it was meant to be.

My parents have wanted a new house for as long as I can remember, so now they've finally achieved it. And I can't be happier for them. It just was a shock to my system, seeing the house this weekend mostly packaged up, the POD storage unit in our driveway waiting to be filled with years of memories (and a whole lot of crap that needs to be thrown away).

So we gathered this weekend, for the last time. We laughed, we cried, we remembered and said good-bye to the old girl. We can only hope she can bring the same happiness she brought us to the new owners.]]></content:encoded>
