	<content:encoded><![CDATA[So it was a fairly simple procedure, I dropped my Escape off over at the Ford dealership for service, something I've done many times before. I got called a couple hours after the drop letting me know the car was ready, I told my service guy that I would pick it up today (Sunday), which was fine with him. We end up over at the place today, I pay my bill (why are brakes so expensive?) and are told that the car will pull around in a minute.

Thirty minutes goes by.
<!--more-->
Christine and I head back into the service center to find out what's going on. It turns out that they lost my keys. Can't find them. They apologize and let me know that they are hunting for them.

20 minutes goes by.

They come to the realization that they don't have my keys anywhere, so they let me know that they will make me a new key. They tell us that it will be another 20 minutes.

30 minutes goes by.

Here's where the story gets truly enjoyable. They realize, that the key making machine is locked. And they don't have the key. Let that sink in. The machine...that makes keys...is locked...and this huge multi-million car dealership which is owned by a multi-billion dollar car company...only has one key for the machine that makes the keys so you can leave with your newly bought car (or newly serviced car that needs new keys after some jackass loses your keys).

So they let me know that hopefully they can get me the car back on Monday or Tuesday. Wonderful.

So I'll never buy a Ford again, never recommend their cars and will never head back to the Greenway Ford store or service center again (Well I have to pick up my car). Now you may say, "That's a bit extreme for only losing your car keys", well I would say..."THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME!!!!!" Yes, it has happened to Christine and I before, we must be gluttons for punishment. The service center has also pretty much sucked ass for quite some time so this was what pushed me over the edge.

So in conclusion, Ford sucks, don't buy from them and if you must buy a Ford don't buy one at Greenway Ford in Orlando.

Thanks for reading my insane ranting.]]></content:encoded>
