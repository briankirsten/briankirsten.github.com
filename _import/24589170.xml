Fame only costs your freedom. In 2046, American media personalities
must obtain an officially sanctioned "performance card" or face
internment in "terror aversion camps". Musician Amanda Casey is a rebel
spreading the truth about her government's corruption via seemingly
innocent love songs. What happens when she is found out? Written by CJ
Hurtt with art by Shawn Richter.
