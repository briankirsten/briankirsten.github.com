"Father's Day may seem a funny time to consider the cruelty of U.S. policy toward Cuba. These days it's anything but funny for Carlos Lazo the father of two teenage boys living in Havana.

Carlos made a life for himself in the United States. He learned English. He remarried. He got a job counseling the developmentally disabled. He even joined the Army National Guard after an earthquake struck Washington State, so he could give something back to his adoptive country and state.

In June 2004 Carlos got two weeks of R+R, jumped on a plane, and got as far as the Miami Airport with a charter ticket in his hand all ready to see his sons. But just days before the new Bush travel restrictions went into effect, putting severe and unprecedented limits on the rights of Cuban Americans to see their families, Carlos was turned away. He had to return to Iraq, not knowing if he'd see his sons again."
