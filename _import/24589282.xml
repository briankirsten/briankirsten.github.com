	<content:encoded><![CDATA[Publishing comic books for me is both business and pleasure. The business side is tough, getting books into people's hands can be quite an undertaking. The pleasure side is seeing those books in people's hands and having them (GASP!) enjoy them. I had a personal note to myself for quite some time after hearing about <a href="http://www.wowio.com">Wowio</a> starting. The note just said "Contact Wowio", and it took me WAY too long to get to them. But I'm glad I did. For those of you who don't know, Wowio offers books and comics on their website for free. Yes I know it sounds like magic, but it's that simple. You download, myself and the creators we represent get paid. Which is a wonderful thing. No this isn't Brain Scan's attempt to thumb our noses at the hard working retailers out there who tirelessly sell our books and the books of our competitors. We just see it as opening the field to folks who might not ever have thought to pick up a comic or walk into a comic shop.

And we feel really good about that.
