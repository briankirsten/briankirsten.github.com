	<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the last couple of weeks, me and the wife have been attempting to get better at the game of golf. We have learned many things:

1) Bring cash for the drink girl
2) Driving a golf cart in the rain is really fun
3) Bring extra golf balls, I MEAN EXTRA!

We've discovered the biggest problem we have with the game is the whole swinging at the ball to get it to move bit. We can swing a club, we can hit the ball, but getting it to go anywhere...WHOO BOY!...that's tough stuff. Anyway while checking the network latency at work today I came across this.
