	<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the very few of you that subscribe to this blog I've made a few changes. First off I'm redirecting folks to my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheMonkeyKingsDomain">Feedburner</a> version of my feed, for a variety of reasons, such as they automagically add new images from my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeyking/">Flickr gallery</a> when I post them and Feedburner adds my <a href="http://del.icio.us/bkirsten">Del.icio.us</a> bookmarks to the feed as well. Also Feedburner provides a cute little image indicating how many of you are subscribed, which is nice (or depressing).

I just added the Del.icio.us bookmark bit because I've been using that service a bit more often and I've decided just posting a link I like (for research or whatnot) on this blog is silly, unless I want to provide some commentary on the link. Most times I don't, so throwing it into deli.icio.us works for me.]]></content:encoded>
