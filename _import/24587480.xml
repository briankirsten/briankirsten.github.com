Comics to me don't get the respect they deserve, they should be treated more like literature and the public can be made to understand that comics are more than just capes and superpowers. I don't think comics need saving. But, without sounding like a broken record it's a larger audience that will help the industry become the best it can be. And an organization like this can possibly help the comics industry do just that.]]></content:encoded>
