"Vaughn was apparently concerned about uprooting his family and moving them to Los Angeles and Vancouver during the shoot.

Fox president Hutch Parker told The Hollywood Reporter, "We understand Matthew's reasons for leaving, as nothing is more important than family. Luckily, we have a fantastic script, the original cast is returning, and there will be some great new characters.

We will decide shortly among several directors who are keenly interested in the project and are fully committed to remaining right on schedule."
