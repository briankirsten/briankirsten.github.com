	<content:encoded><![CDATA[Got around to reading Rude's <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/profile/profile.php?sku=13-148">The Moth</a> tonight. The art's nice, but is the series supposed to be funny? Not really laugh out loud funny, but more like...don't take it seriously funny? I got a whole <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/profile/profile.php?sku=12-592">The Goon</a> vibe from the whole thing. Was that their intent? If so, then they did a good job, if not, well ummm, good luck with that whole thing there. Ya.
I have to say there were cringe worthy bits of dialog in the book, and a majority of the rest of the dialog seemed a bit stiff to me. And everytime the biker gang spoke I wish I was just watching a DVD so I could quickly fast forward whatever crap they were spewing.

But, like I said before, the art's pretty decent.]]></content:encoded>
