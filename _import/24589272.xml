	<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love a good steak sandwich, so I was excited to come across a "Flank Steak and Boursin Cheese Sandwich" recipe that I had to try. I was initially unhappy with the recipe because it didn't call for doing anything special to the steak, just simply throwing it on the grill until complete. I had some prior experience with a marinade from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FIm-Just-Here-Food-Cooking%2Fdp%2F1584790830&amp;tag=urbanossurfshop&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Alton Brown's "I'm Just Here for the Food: Food + Heat = Cooking"</a> book so I went with that.
Take the flank steak (I used 1/2 pound) and place into a plastic bag with five (5) tablespoons soy, one and one half (1 1/2) tablespoons honey, and one (1) tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, seal the bag and place into the refrigerator for a nice rest (I recommend putting the bag into a bowl just in case of any possible spillage). I marinated the steak overnight but I would guess you could marinate as long or as little as you want.
About an hour before lunch the next day, I took the steak out of the fridge to come up to room temperature. I set it aside to prepare the onion rings. I chopped an onion into rings (well more like strips), and got out a large-ish bowl for the batter. Into the bowl I dumped one and a half (1 1/2) cups of flour, pinch of salt, and big pinch of paprika. Mix that around with a spoon (or better your hands). On top of that mixture I poured a bottle of beer I had left over in the fridge (now that we have a house with a guest room, guests always seem to be bringing beer and there always seems to be an oddball beer left over). Mix that concoction until there are no lumps. I folded the onions into the batter making sure they were all covered with the goo. I heated up a deep sided frying pan with about an inch of vegetable oil over medium high heat.
When the oil came to temperature I dropped in my first batch of rings, cooking them to a golden brown. I wasn't really happy with the overwhelming amount of batter on the first batch, so I hunted around for a colander and dumped the uncooked rings &amp; batter into that to thin it out a bit. After thinning I cooked the rest to golden brown, perfecto! Set aside covered to keep the rings warm.
I moved my top rack in my oven up so the steak would rest a couple inches from the upper heating coil, I then set the oven to "High" broil. Cook the steak under the broiler for 3-4 minutes on each side, then let the steak rest on a cutting board for five (5) minutes. With the residual heat of the oven, I warmed a nice sized baguette for the sandwiches.
After toasting the baguette, split and spread a nice layer of Boursin cheese on the bread. Follow with the warm rings, and top that with the steak thinly sliced. So it wouldn't be too unhealthy I finished the sandwiches off with Romaine lettuce. Serve with remaining onion rings.

Things I would have done different.
   - The marinade I had left over I should have warmed into a nice dipping sauce.
   - The rings, next time I'm stuffing the onion into the blender on puree then folding into the batter. That whole mess will go into a piping bag and then....ONION RING FUNNEL CAKE! My mouth waters thinking of it.]]></content:encoded>
