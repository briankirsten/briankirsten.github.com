	<content:encoded><![CDATA[Went to the comic shop today (2 days in a row!) cause today is Wednesday and for those of you who aren't in the know, the fourth day of the week means new comics. Not a whole heck of a lot in my pull list this week. Haven't had the chance to read much of the pile yet, did of course tear into the new <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/ws_display.html?cm_ws_itemCode=planet19&amp;month=March">Planetary</a>. All I can say is, if you aren't reading the book, stop reading this blog, get up and go get it. It's a great series, wonderful art, with wonderful words to go along with it. Those who enjoy sci-fi should enjoy the series.

Also read the last issue of The Ultimates, now first off I never really had any intent of picking up this series. It wasn't my cup of tea, Thor, some sort of Ant Guy, Captain America, mmm not my idea of a great time. But then I heard all the buzz about it and picked it up (a later issue I guess #7). I won't lie, I enjoyed it, sadly it followed the "when we damn well feel like it" release schedule, but when I saw a new one was on the shelf I picked it up.

Now that being said, I guess you could call me a comic "entreprenuer" (buy <a href="http://www.touch-of-death.com">Touch of Death</a> in stores now!), so I enjoy following the sales figures of all the wonderful funny books every month. And guess what, there was Ultimates usually high up on the list everytime one came out. So my mouth dropped open when I heard that it wasn't coming back. Not from the fan in me going "No! I need to find out what happens between Ant Man and Wasp Woman (or whoever the hell that is)", my shock was more along the lines of "they were making some decent scratch on that series, WHAT THE HAPPY HELL WENT HORRIBLY WRONG?". And I suppose we will never know, or maybe they have told us and I haven't paid any attention.

Anyway I got the last one of the bunch, and yes as expected all loose ends are pretty much tied up. Much ass-kicking commences, good guys win, much drinking and dancing by all. As it should be. Will I pick up the Volume 2 when and if that ever comes out? If the creative team is roughly the same, probably. Do I recommend this issue to the comic buying public? Well if you haven't read one issue of the book, you probably won't know what the hell is going on. The average reader though would probably figure it out pretty quickly and there is some enjoyable art throughout the book that makes up for any confusion from first timers. If you've followed the series through, well you already have this book or have all the intent in the world in buying it anyway.]]></content:encoded>
