	<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll blog about computer problems! So I got home from <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/">San Diego</a> on Monday, heading back into a hectic work week. Sometime mid-week the server that had been running this site and a couple of other sites started making a clicking noise.

That's never good.

It sounded like the hard drive in the machine was on it's last legs. I removed the machine from it's closet home (in my bedroom), opened her up, dusted it out and moved it to my office. It ran for about a day, then seized up again. Nothing. She was kaput, dead as a doornail.

So on Saturday we combed Orlando ("Comb the desert!"), for an inexpensive machine I can throw <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Redhat</a> on and rebuild into a bigger, better webserver. We found one at the <a href="http://www.cbwnet.com/index.php">Computer Builders Warehouse</a> near my work, a barebones unit, that we just had to throw a hard drive and cd-rom into. And that's what is serving these pages right now. Hooray for linux!
